# Comet-Changelog

## For users coming by:
This repo contains the changelog classified by version of every release of the mod, with the intention of making a version history documenting content added with each patch.

This can be useful to users familiarized with this mod in order to see what's new in the latest version.

#### If you are unfamiliar with ![Comet](https://github.com/Soulphur0/Comet/wiki), I'd recommend you to consult ![its wiki](https://github.com/Soulphur0/Comet/wiki) instead.

## Details of the repo
There are several folders in the root of the repo, each one containing the changelog for every major version released (1.0.0, 1.1.0, 1.2.0,...) followed by the changelog of every minor release (1.0.1, 1.0.2, 1.0.3,...).

Usually major releases are the ones which add content to the mod (blocks, items, etc.) and minor releases focus on bug fixing and tweaking, but there could be exceptions.
